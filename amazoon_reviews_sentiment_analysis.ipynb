Many have heard that they should read this book because it's a classic, or because of the amazing predictions from 1949 about life in the future. Everyone should read this book.If you read it hoping to find action, or hoping to find a tie to the world as we know it, you most likely won't comprehend the actual meaning of the words. You'll be most successful if you consider what we have today compared to what we had when Orwell wrote the book in 1949. Think of how much the world has changed, and how far there is left to go.Read this book, and every chapter think of the relationship to everyday life. This isn't a book that should be skimmed. Think of the implications of Orwell's predictions. Realize that it could happen.Is it a novel, or is it possible? Are we starting to live in Orwell's world?\"\n",

The song \"Wanna Get Up\" in (my) opinion is not as good as other tracks released by the band, since there\\'s no techno-rapping by Ray, and not as good vocals & lyrics. On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On \"Wanna Get Up\" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the \"SASH! Extended Edit\" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version. The other two remixes are extrermely poor and do not relate with the type of music 2 Unlimited sings.'\n",

Most of the CD flows pretty easily, the lyrics actually say something, and avoid \"bad/sad\"-type cheesy rhymes. Faded and No One Does It Better are far and away the best, but that doesn\\'t mean the others aren\\'t good. Looking for a strong sophomore effort to keep Canada on the music map..

It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever).

I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental.

Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books.
